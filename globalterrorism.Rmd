## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Importing dataset

We are also replacing the empty cells with "NA" cells to make the use of the is.na easier. This helps us tidying up the dataset.

```{r}
if (!file.exists("globalterrorism_dataset.zip")) {
    download.file("https://github.com/JBrO910/DASC_Research/raw/main/globalterrorism_dataset.zip",
                  "globalterrorism_dataset.zip")
    unzip("globalterrorism_dataset.zip")
}

globalterrorism <- read.csv("globalterrorism.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"), header = TRUE)
#globalterrorism
```

## Deleting columns with more than 90% missing values

As we looked over the dataset we have found out that many columns have a lot or almost none filled rows. So we decided that all columns that have more than 90 % missing values shall be removed. Our intention for this is that we only use the columns that actually have some filled out cells.

```{r}
na_count <- sapply(globalterrorism, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))
na_count <- data.frame(na_count)

# Get row name as a column 
na_count_table <- setDT(na_count, keep.rownames = TRUE)[]
na_count_table <- data.frame(na_count_table)

# Calculate the percentage of missing values. Limit to two decimals after the dot.
na_percentage <- sapply(na_count_table$na_count, function(x) as.double(format(round( x/nrow(globalterrorism ), 2), nsmall = 2)))
na_percentage_table <- data.frame(na_count_table, na_percentage)
na_percentage_table

# Filtering so that only the rows exist that are have less than 90 % missing values
na_percentage_filtered <- subset(na_percentage_table, na_percentage_table$na_percentage < 0.90)
na_percentage_filtered

# Removal of the columns
globalterrorism_done <- globalterrorism %>% select(one_of(na_percentage_filtered$rn))
globalterrorism_done
```



## World map with all locations of terrorism attacks

We created a map with and set a geom_point for each location of a terrorism attack. In the dataset we have the longitude and latitude coordinates of each terrorism attack. With these coordinates we can set a point on the map.
We also animated the map by cycling through the years. This helps with the the overall visibility of the map.

WARNING: The compilation of this map may take a few minutes!

```{r}
# Retrieving all coordinates from the dataset. But the NA values have to be filtered out first.
globalterrorism_coordinates <- globalterrorism_done %>% filter(!is.na(globalterrorism_done$longitude)) 

# We have found out that one of the coordinates has been added incorrect. Therefore we are also filtering that out.
globalterrorism_coordinates <- globalterrorism_coordinates %>% filter(globalterrorism_coordinates$longitude > -180)
globalterrorism_coordinates

# Create start and end variables for the animation
map_animation_start <- tibble(iyear = 1969, longitude = 0, latitude = 0)
map_animation_end <- tibble(iyear = 2018, longitude = 0, latitude = 0)

# Setting up the map
map_base <- map("worldHires", fill = T, plot = F)
map_base <- st_as_sf(map_base)
map_base <- st_make_valid(map_base)

# Adding the points to the map. The start and end variables for the animation are also added here. We are also doing additional labeling for longitude and latitude.
points_map <- ggplot() + geom_sf(data = map_base) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude,
                 frame = iyear,
                 cumulative = TRUE),
             data = globalterrorism_coordinates, colour = "purple",  size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude,
                 frame = iyear,
                 cumulative = TRUE),
             data = map_animation_start, colour = "purple", size = 0) +
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude,
                 frame = iyear,
                 cumulative = TRUE),
             data = map_animation_end, colour = "purple", size = 0) +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", fill = "") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(colour = "transparent"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14))

# Start animation with an interval of 0.2 seconds.
gganimate(points_map, interval = 0.2) 
```


## Number of terrorism attacks every year (excluding 1993)

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) lost the data of the year 1993 due to a compilation error. That's why we don't have any data from that particular year.

```{r}
ggplot(data = globalterrorism_done, mapping = aes(iyear, sum(iyear))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
