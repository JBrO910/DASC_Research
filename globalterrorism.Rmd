## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Libraries
```{r}
install.packages("data.table")
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
```


## Importing dataset

We are also replacing the empty cells with "NA" cells to make the use of the is.na easier. This helps us tidying up the dataset.

```{r}
globalterrorism <- read.csv("globalterrorism.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"), header = TRUE)
#globalterrorism
```

## Deleting columns with more than 90% missing values

As we looked over the dataset we have found out that many columns have a lot or almost none filled rows. So we decided that all columns that have more than 90 % missing values shall be removed. Our intention for this is that we only use the columns that actually have some filled out cells.

```{r}
na_count <- sapply(globalterrorism, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))
na_count <- data.frame(na_count)

# Get row name as a column 
na_count_table <- setDT(na_count, keep.rownames = TRUE)[]
na_count_table <- data.frame(na_count_table)

# Calculate the percentage of missing values
na_percentage <- sapply(na_count_table$na_count, function(x) as.double(format(round( x/nrow(globalterrorism ), 2), nsmall = 2)))
na_percentage_table <- data.frame(na_count_table, na_percentage)
na_percentage_table

# Filtering so that only the rows exist that are have less than 90 % missing values
na_percentage_filtered <- subset(na_percentage_table, na_percentage_table$na_percentage < 0.90)
na_percentage_filtered

# Removal of the columns
globalterrorism <- globalterrorism %>% select(one_of(na_percentage_filtered$rn))
```

```{r}


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
